//Notice that super() is passed an object of type BoxWeightâ€”not of type Box.This still invokes the constructor Box(Box ob).
// NOTE: A superclass variable can be used to reference any object derived from that class.
// Thus, we are able to pass a BoxWeight object to the Box constructor.Of course,Box only has knowledge of its own members.
